# SI507_Exoplanet-Habitability-Network-Visualizer


This Python tool creates an interactive network visualization of exoplanets based on their similarity to Earth. The system:

1) Fetches data directly from NASA's Exoplanet Archive API

2) Calculates similarity between planets using physical characteristics

3) Generates an interactive web-based visualization with:

4) Earth-centered network layout

5) Color/size coding by Earth similarity

6) Detailed tooltips with planetary data

7) Physics-based interactions
